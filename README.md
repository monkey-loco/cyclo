### [▶ Play Cyclo](https://monkey-loco.github.io/cyclo/)

Cyclo is a loop-based incremental/clicker game where you generate currency through nested orbital systems. Starting with a single ring, you progress by unlocking deeper dimensions and more complex structures, compounding your production over time.

Cyclo began as a submission for the **GMTK Game Jam 2025** and received great feedback, so I plan on making content updates.

Play the original jam version here: [Cyclo on Itch.io](https://bicubic.itch.io/cyclo)
